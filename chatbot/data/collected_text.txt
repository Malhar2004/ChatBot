Vision

To develop competent Mechanical Engineers through an industry oriented program to serve the society

Mission

To impart quality technical education to meet intellectual, ethical and career challenges.
To inculcate self- learning ability and develop communication & teamwork skills in students to excel in the profession.

Dr. Sushant S. Satputaley

HOD’s Message
The evergreen branch, from the day the stone age man chiseled his first tool, the fold of mechanical engineering has come a long way. Today, apart from the core areas like the automobile industry, mining, aerospace engineering and material sciences, a mechanical engineer finds his utility in areas such as the IT industry and banking sectors. Mechanical engineering is based on the various principles of mechanics, kinematics, thermodynamics, fluid mechanics and energy. Mechanical engineers use the core principles and knowledge in the field to design and analyze manufacturing plants, industrial equipment and machinery, heating and cooling systems, motor vehicles, aircraft, robots and more. Thus, the scope for a mechanical engineer in any part of the world is unlimited.

Future Prospects

Mechanical Engineering have good prospects in industry as well as higher studies. Mechanical Engineering jobs don’t mean to work in a workshop like a labor. There are plenty of office work and because of vast application of computers in mechanical engineering. All designing and manufacturing process is automated and computerized. Therefore the job profile for mechanical engineering is almost similar to a computer engineer.

Core Companies offering Mechanical Engineering Jobs: ISRO, DRDO, Indian Railway, ABB, TATA Motors, General Motors, Fiat, Reliance Industries, Reliance Power Ltd, Asoka Leyland, Mahindra and Mahindra to name few.

Autonomy Curriculum (2023-24)

Vision

To become a centre of excellence in the field of Artificial Intelligence, enabling students with a high level of technical and practical capabilities to address the needs of industry and society.

Mission

To develop skilled professionals in the field of artificial intelligence (AI).
To provide high-quality, value-based education and to contribute to computing, expert systems, and data science innovation in order to increase the level of satisfaction among all stakeholders.
Our goal is to use cutting-edge high-performance computing technology and software.

Mr. Vikas G.  Bhowate

Incharge Message
B. Tech. in Artificial Intelligence is an undergraduate programme that offers advanced learning solutions and emphasizes advanced innovations such as machine learning, also known as deep learning and artificial intelligence.
With a cutting-edge combination of machine learning, analytics, and visualisation technologies, students will be able to construct intelligent machines, software, or applications. Artificial intelligence (AI) has as their major goal the programming of computers to solve problems using example data or experience. Many successful machine learning applications already exist, such as systems that analyse past sales data to predict customer behaviour (financial management), recognise faces or spoken speech, optimise robot behaviour to complete a task with minimal resources, and extract knowledge from bioinformatics data.
This curriculum examines AI methods from several domains, such as neural networks, signal processing, Gaming, Data Analytics and data mining, in order to give a comprehensive examination of machine learning challenges and solutions.

St. Vincent Pallotti

Our Founder & Inspiration

St. Vincent Pallotti was a Catholic priest who founded the society of the Catholic Apostolate (SAC), commonly known as the Pallottines, around 150 years ago. Born on April 21, 1795, Pallotti was canonized in 1963. His commitment to his apostolate led him to start orphanages, night schools and technical institutions that exist even today. Besides, he had special compassion for prisoners, soldiers and the sick. He was also the spiritual director of several Roman Colleges. The society founded by Pallotti has numerous institutions in 46 countries across the globe. In India, the Pallottines have premier educational as well as institutions of higher learning in Maharashtra, Goa, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, Delhi, Jharkhand, Bihar, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Kerala. The Nagpur Pallottine Society Nagpur, which manages St. Vincent Pallotti College of Engineering & Technology, is a part of this International Society.

Faith Perspective

Message by His Holiness, Pope Francis

The profound responsibility to lead the young to truth is nothing less than an act of love. Indeed, the dignity of education lies in fostering the true perfection and happiness of those to be educated. In practice, ‘intellectual charity” upholds the essential unity of knowledge against the fragmentation which ensues when reason is detached from the pursuit of truth. It guides the young towards the deep satisfaction of exercising freedom in relation to truth, and it strives to articulate the relationship between faith and all aspects of family and civic life .Once their passion for the fullness and unity of truth has been awakened, young people will surely relish the discovery that the question of what they can know opens up the vast adventure of what they ought to do. Here they will experience “in what” and “in whom” it is possible to hope, and be inspired to contribute to society in a way that engenders hope in others.

Rt. Rev. Archbishop Elias Gonsalve

An Education that energizes the young to take up the task of contributing to nation-building, so as to evolve a new Inclusive Indian Society, an India of their dreams, which they can own with pride and joy.

Rev. Fr. Zenon Hanas SAC

An Education that thus forms the young to evolve as men and women of character, competence, conscience, compassion and commitment, who will then contribute to the evolution of a counter-culture to the present ruthlessly competitive model, by promoting collaboration and cooperation for the growth of all, in a climate of mutual trust and sharing; and to the shockingly corrupt society, by fostering uprightness in public life.

Vision

To develop professionally competent and socially conscious Electrical Engineers ready to face challenges in a global environment.

Mission

To impart knowledge through curricular & co-curricular programs to understand modern electrical technologies.
To develop technically strong and safety conscious electrical engineers with leadership qualities to meet industry needs.
To inculcate ethical values, discipline and teamwork in students, to become successful global professionals.

Dr. Nitin K. Dhote

HOD’s Message

Electrical Engineering is a branch of engineering that deals with the study and application of electricity, electronics, and electromagnetism. It is one of the core branches of Engineering studies. Most of the branches like Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering, Computer Science, Instrumentation, Information Technology have emerged as a specialization from Electrical Engineering.
Privatization of the power sector and renewable energy purchase obligation has lead to global competition and investments of thousands of crores generating high demand for Electrical Engineers in near future.
The Department of Electrical Engineering was established in 2004. It has experienced and qualified teaching and non teaching staff. The Department is accredited by the National Board of Accreditation (NBA), an independent body set up by AICTE, New Delhi. The Department has MoUs with many industries, thus bridging the gap between Institute and Industry through internships, training programs, guest lectures, industry based projects and other interaction programs.
